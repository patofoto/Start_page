## How It's Built

This runs on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) (free tier). Your data is stored in [Cloudflare KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/).

No frameworks. No build step. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/csullivan145/Start_page)

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

You need a free [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

### Option A: One-Command Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csullivan145/Start_page.git
cd Start_page
npm install
npm run setup
```

The setup script will:
- Log you into Cloudflare (if needed)
- Create a KV storage namespace
- Ask how you want to sign in (password or Google)
- Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

### Option B: Deploy Button

Click the **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers** button above. On the deploy form:
- Check **"Create private Git repository"** (recommended)
- Select your Git account and create the KV namespace
- **Leave GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET blank** (they're optional — you can set up Google Sign-In later through the setup wizard)
- Click **Create and deploy**

After it deploys, visit your new Workers URL and the setup wizard will walk you through the rest.

### Option C: Manual Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csullivan145/Start_page.git
cd Start_page
npm install
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler kv namespace create START_PAGE_DATA
```

Copy the KV namespace `id` from the output into `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "START_PAGE_DATA"
id = "paste-your-id-here"
```

Then deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### First Visit

After deploying, visit your Workers URL. A setup wizard will guide you through choosing an auth method:

- **Password** (simplest) — Just pick a password. No external setup needed.
- **Google Sign-In** — Uses Google OAuth. The wizard shows you exactly what to configure, including your auto-detected redirect URI.

That's it. Start adding your links.

---

## Authentication

### Password Auth (Recommended for simplicity)

Choose "Password" during the setup wizard. No secrets or external services needed — just set a password and you're in.

### Google Sign-In

If you prefer Google OAuth:

1. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Add your redirect URI (shown in the setup wizard — it's auto-detected, no need to configure it)
3. Set two secrets:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

4. Redeploy: `npm run deploy`

> **Note:** `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` are auto-generated. You only need the two secrets above.

---

## Custom Domain

By default, your page lives at `your-worker.workers.dev`. To use a custom domain:

1. Add your domain to Cloudflare (DNS managed by Cloudflare)
2. Edit `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
routes = [
  { pattern = "yourdomain.com", custom_domain = true }
]
```

3. Redeploy: `npm run deploy`

If using Google Sign-In, add the new domain as an authorized redirect URI in Google Cloud Console.

---

## Optional: Branded Groups

Want your cards to show brand logos and colors? (e.g., a Google card with the Google banner)

1. Sign up at [brandfetch.com](https://brandfetch.com) (free tier available)
2. Get your **API Key** and **Client ID**
3. Go to **Settings → Account → Brandfetch API**
4. Enter both keys and save

Now when you edit a group and check "Branded", enter the company's domain (e.g., `google.com`) and it'll fetch their branding.

---

## Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts a local server at `http://localhost:8788`.

For Google sign-in locally, copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

Password auth works locally with no configuration.

---

## Settings

Click the gear icon (top right, visible after sign-in) to open Settings:

| Tab | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| **Appearance** | Change wallpaper, layout, fonts, and manage sections |
| **Google Apps** | Choose which Google apps show in the launcher |
| **Account** | Set allowed emails, privacy mode, Brandfetch API keys |
| **Data** | Import/export your data as JSON, reset to defaults |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Can't sign in with Google?**
- Make sure your Google OAuth consent screen is set to **Production** (not Testing)
- Check that your redirect URI matches your Workers URL
- Run `npx wrangler secret list` to verify secrets are set

**Page looks broken or outdated?**
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- Try incognito/private window

**Setup wizard won't appear?**
- The wizard only shows when no auth is configured. If you already set up Google OAuth or password auth, it won't show again.
